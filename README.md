# Challenge 2 UC Berkeley Extension Building A Professional Portfolio

## Description

For this project I combined all the information that I learned from the first two weeks fo class about html and css to create a professional portfolio webpage.  This assignement I relied heavily on flexboxes to organize my page, and media query to highlight certain sections.  This was the first project that I built entirely from scratch. As the course progresses and my skills as a programmer advance I will continue improving and adding on to this repo.  It was challenging having to create something from nothing. My vision for the portfolio was constantly changing.  It challenged me to be apprach problems from different angles and to be flexible when things do not work the way I wanted them too.
