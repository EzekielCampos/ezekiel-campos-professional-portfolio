            Welcome to my portfolio page!  My journey in programming began little over a year ago when I began learning to code in C/C++.  
            I took a course with UCSD extension as a testing ground to see if I had the potential to become a programmer.  The learning 
            curve was pretty steep coming from no experience in computer science.  However, after taking the first few courses I was so 
            fascinated about the capabilities that one could do with coding that I was hooked! I wanted learn more and continue to develop 
            my skills to be competitive when I began applying for jobs. I am currently attending a coding bootcamp through UC Berkeley Extension 
            to learn more about programming in the hope to land a position as a full stack developer.  My goal is to find an entry level 
            position as software engineer, and to find a company that wants to invest in me so that I can continue to build on my skills 
            as a programmer and a leader. </p>
